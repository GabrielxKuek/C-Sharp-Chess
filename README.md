## About The Project

Kitchen Chaos is my first full Unity game project, developed by following CodeMonkey's comprehensive tutorial. What sets this project apart is its emphasis on clean code architecture and industry-standard practices, making it an excellent foundation for understanding professional game development principles.

This project was chosen specifically because it focuses on writing maintainable, production-quality code rather than quick prototypes. It demonstrates proper software engineering practices within the context of game development.

### Built With
* Unity 2021.3+
* C#
* Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
* Input System Package
* Cinemachine

## Technical Highlights

This project implements several advanced concepts and patterns:

* **State Machine Pattern** - For managing cooking states and game flow
* **Singleton Pattern** - Used thoughtfully for global managers
* **Event System** - Implementing C# events for decoupled communication
* **Scriptable Objects** - For flexible data management
* **Interface Implementation** - Using C# interfaces for clean interaction systems
* **Input System** - Modern input handling with rebinding support
* **Shader Graph** - Custom shaders for visual effects
* **Clean Architecture** - Following SOLID principles and clean code practices
